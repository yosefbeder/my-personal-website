## Who am I?

I'm a high school student in my freshman year, and I want to be a programmer.

At the moment, I focus on creating as many projects as I can to be comfortable with making good-looking apps and front-end modern tools such as React, Typescript, and Next.js.

### Learning

I've been learning to code for exactly <strong id="learning-from"></strong> mostly by watching Udemy courses and sometimes by reading docs.

### Projects

In the last two months or so I went out of my comfort zone and created some cool projects like an [E-commerce app](https://yosefbeder.github.io/cubeshop/#/products) in which I used [Commercejs](https://commercejs.com/) for handling backend and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for handling payment.

I also created my own [React component library](https://github.com/yosefbeder/react-emoji-picker/packages/949720) which is an emoji-picker and it's highly configurable, btw you can try playing with it from the [Demo version](https://yosefbeder.github.io/react-emoji-picker/).

I also implemented things like history with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) in a simple [Drawing app](https://yosefbeder.github.io/drawing-pad/).

I also created this blog ðŸ˜….

You can check the rest of my projects from my [Github account](https://github.com/yosefbeder).

## Why did I create this Blog?

I wanted to have a blog because I want to share the new stuff that I learn, and my experiences learning new technologies.

Also, I wanted to create some tutorials on the things that I learn to understand better.
