## About me

I'm a high school student in my freshman year.

I've been learning to code for exactly <strong id="learning-from"></strong>.

During my first 1 year and 3 months, I learned frontend basics and practiced them in [several projects](#projects) (If you want to know more details about my learning journey I wrote [an article about it](/articles/reflecting-on-my-first-1500-hours-of-coding)).

Recently I've been concerned with Computer Science basic concepts.

I've bought [Computer Science 101: Master the Theory Behind Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-science-101-master-the-theory-behind-programming/), and at the moment, I study it.

I also work on some side projects to retain my frontend skills.

## Projects

- Personal website ([GitHub](https://github.com/yosefbeder/my-personal-website))

  - The biggest project I've ever made.
  - The place in which I put all of the new things I learn.
  - If you want to see the imporvement of this blog, [this is the version that was deployed on 10 September](https://my-personal-website-cspvogaeu-yosefbeder.vercel.app/).

- Design system ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yosefbeder/design-system) - [GitHub](https://github.com/yosefbeder/design-system) - [Demo](https://yosefbeder.github.io/design-system/))

  - My own design system.
  - Made with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).
  - It's not just a set of components, It contains some CSS custom variables.
  - I created it so that I can create my future projects faster âš¡.

- Code editor ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yosefbeder/react-throwcode) - [GitHub](https://github.com/yosefbeder/react-throwcode) - [Demo](https://yosefbeder.github.io/react-throwcode/))

  - A small code editor component.
  - Not really a series project, but It was a great challenge to boost my skills.
  - Until now, It's the most complicated project I've ever done in terms of manipulating the DOM and thinking about the logic.
  - It supports undo/redo, line numbers, code highlighting, light and dark themes, auto-indentation, and auto special tags closing.

### Small projects

- Projectiles

  - This project consists of two code sandboxes.
    1. [Projectiles curve](https://codesandbox.io/s/projectiles-curve-phhll): which draws that the projectile will follow by entering some inputs (vi and deg).
    2. [Projectiles motion](https://codesandbox.io/s/projectile-motion-l0tlr?file=/src/App.js): which stimulates the movement of projectile by entering the same inputs.
  - I adore these two projects because they allowed me to apply the formulas I studied at school.
  - They also allowed me to cheat and solve some "Multiple Choice Questions" ðŸ¤«.
  - If you want to know the physics behind them check [Two-dimensional motion](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/two-dimensional-motion).

- Emoji picker ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yosefbeder/react-emojis) - [GitHub](https://github.com/yosefbeder/react-emojis) - [Demo](https://yosefbeder.github.io/react-emojis/))

  - A simple emoji picker component.

- Typing test ([GitHub](https://github.com/yosefbeder/typing-speed-test) - [Live](https://yosefbeder.github.io/typing-speed-test/))

  - A typing test project with an animated cursor.
  - The best thing in this project is the animated cursor because I animated it **manually**.

- Drawing pad ([GitHub](https://github.com/yosefbeder/drawing-pad) - [Live](https://yosefbeder.github.io/drawing-pad/))

  - The first time for me to implement undo/redo and use the canvas API.

- Weather ([GitHub](https://github.com/yosefbeder/weather) - [Live](https://yosefbeder.github.io/weather/))

  - This is one of the first projects in which I practiced React so I really like it.
  - This is the first app I made after reading about UI designing fundamentals and watching [Learn UI design fundamentals](https://scrimba.com/learn/design).
