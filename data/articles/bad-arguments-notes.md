## Fallacies

### Argument from consequences

It's to judge whether something is right or not from it's consequences like for example using "If God doesn't exist, then everything is permitted" for arguing that God exists.

### Strawman

It's distorting another's argument to beat him instead of collecting evedences against him.

### Appealing to irrelevant authority

Referencing what specialized people say in things not related to the thing that they're specialized in.
The most common example of this fallacy is referencing what old people have told.

### Equivocation

It means using another meaning of a word in one argument like for example How can you be against faith when we take
leapsÂ ofÂ faithÂ allÂ theÂ time,Â withÂ friendsÂ andÂ potentialÂ spousesÂ andÂ investments?

### False dilemma

It's forcing someone to just choose one of two options and excluding all the others.

### Correlation doesn't imply causation

If two things happens with each others they shouldn't be linked or depend on each other like for example people who eat chocolate are more likely to win the Noble prize.

### Appealing to fear

Trying to convince others about the consequences of a certain thing instead of trying to argue if these consequences will happen for example saying that don't vote for Mr frog because he will run all of the university by frogs.

### Hasty generalization

It's creating some rules from special cases or a small number of cases, like for example asking 10 people about their opinions about the plan of the new president, and then workouting the opinion of the whole nation from the opinion of those.

### Appeal to ignorance

It's simply saying thst something is true because there's no evidence that it's false.
Like for example arguing that there're useless parts in the human body, because we simply don't know it's function.

### Genetic fallacy

It's simply attacking the history of the teller if the argument.

### Guilt by association

Simply attacking an argument because it's associated to some bad people (or at least as you think).

For example some people attacked the women right to drive by saying that godless nations let their women drive.

### Affirming the consequent

If A then C, A; hence C.
Here A is called antecedent and C is called consequent.
This is a valid argument.
An example of it would be If some water is boiling in a glass of water (A), then the temperature of the water in this glass should be at least 100Â°C (C).

If A then C, C; hence A.
In here we assume that if the consequent is true then the antecedent should be true.
For example if the bulb is broken, then the room is dark.
So if the room is dark, the bulb is broken ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜¼.

### Tu quoque

Person A claims that the statement X is true.
Person B asserts that person A's actions and old claims are inconsistent with the statement X.
Therefore the statement X isn't true.

### Slippery slope

Descrediting a preposition by claiming that it's acceptance will undoubtedly lead to a sequent of events which are undesirable.

Like saying
If you donâ€™t do your homework, youâ€™ll fail the class.
If you fail this class, you wonâ€™t graduate from school.
If you donâ€™t graduate, you wonâ€™t get into college.
If you donâ€™t attend a good college, you wonâ€™t get a good job.
If you donâ€™t get a good job, youâ€™ll be poor and homeless.
You donâ€™t want to be poor and homeless, do you?

### Appeal to bandwagon

Supposing that if a lot of people believe in an idea then it's true

### Circular reasoning

In this one you can't believe the premise unless you believe the conclusion.
This is the form of it.
A is true because B is true; B is true because A is true.

Examples
You must obey the law, because itâ€™s illegal to break the law.
Haroldâ€™s new book is well written, because Harold is a wonderful writer.
America is the best place to live, because itâ€™s better than any other country.

## Jargons

- Preposition: a statement that can be either true or false like Cairo is the capital of Egypt.

- Premise: a preposition that supports the argument's conclusion.

- Conclusion: the preposition that we support with some other prepositions (premises) in an argument.

- Deductive argument: an argument in which if the premises are true then the conclusion must be true.

  - All numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5. The number 35 ends with a 5, so it must be divisible by 5.
    As you notice here we go from general to specific.

- Inductive argument: an argument in which if the premises are true then the conclusion is likely to be true.

  - The coin I pulled from the bag is penny therefore all of the coins in this bag are pennies.
    Here we started from specific to general.

- Inductive reasoning is used in science to build theories and hypothesis.

  - In the scientific method we use deductive reasoning to test a theory, based on the theory we predict the consequences of an experiment before doing it and if they were true then the theory is true.
