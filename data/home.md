## Who am I?

I'm a high school student in my freshman year and I want to be a programmer, and I've been learning programing since the middle of June 2020.

### Learning

I've Learned a lot of things in this period starting with the Basics (html, css, and javascript) to more interesting techonologies like React, and Typescript.

I learned all of these stuff by buying udemy courses and studying them and practicing them.

Before two month or so I started to practice my knowledge so I created these sites.

### Projects

#### Drawing Pad

A simple drawing pad with basic features (like a pen, and an eraser), and some cool features like undo and redo.

The main goal of creating this project is to practice the stuff that I read in this [article](https://redux.js.org/usage/implementing-undo-history)

#### Cube Shop

[Live Preview](https://yosefbeder.github.io/cubeshop/) - [Code](https://github.com/yosefbeder/cubeshop)

Maybe this is the coolest project that I've programmed and It's simply an e-commerce app.

It's made with React and commerce.js.

I learened tons of things programing this one like

- Using commerce.js SDK.
  - Which is pretty cool
- Adding payment with Stripe.
- Dealing with routing and a big number of pages.
- Using architectures in larger projects.
- Planning the project and organizing it by Trello.

#### React Emoji Picker

This is the my first react component library.

I learned tons of stuff that I was facing when I use others libraries, like callback functions which are pretty obvious, but I had to thought a lot about implementing them.

I tried to create my own configs with webpack a lot but I failed, so I had to create a custom tsconfig file to build it.

## Why did I create this Blog?

I wanted to have a blog because I want to share the knowledge that I'm gaining, and my experience learning new technologies.

Also I wanted to create some tutorials on the things that I learn to understand it better.
